# Turtul Budget

Non-intrusive, free, open source budget software.

**Why Another Budget App?:**

Turtul Budget is intended to be a simple, intuitive alternative for users who want to manually track and categorize expenses, while retaining full control over their financial data. It runs in the browser, and there are no logins, bank or credit card information required. All budget data is stored in an optionally encrypted file in a location of the user's choosing.
